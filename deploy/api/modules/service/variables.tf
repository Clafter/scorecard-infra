    Whether the task role may WRITE to the primary results bucket.

    False by default, and that default is the safety-critical part. Staging and
    production read the same corpus, because conformance against an empty bucket
    would prove nothing -- every request would 404 identically whether or not
    the service worked. But the API's publish path writes results into whichever
    bucket it reads as primary, so a staging deployment granted PutObject would
    be able to overwrite production results with output from an unproven build.

    Reads are shared; writes are not. Only production sets this true. Staging
    consequently fails the POST path by design, which costs nothing here: the
    conformance harness is GET requests, and the publish path is gated
    separately by watching a real Action upload land in production.
