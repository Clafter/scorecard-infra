as a service — and the work to make it run anywhere.

## About The Project

`ossf/scorecard` is the **engine**: checks, probes, scoring, output formats. This
repository is what surrounds it — the batch pipeline that scans 1M+ repositories
every week, the API that serves what it produces, and the design for moving that
stack off any single cloud provider.

| | Path | Role | State |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Batch scanning pipeline** | `cron/` | **Producer** — scans 1M+ repositories weekly and writes results to object storage | Production on AWS (live 2026-09-06). Imported from `ossf/scorecard`. |
| **Results API** | `api/` | **Serving tier** — the service behind `api.scorecard.dev` | Production on AWS. Imported from `ossf/scorecard-webapp`. **This is what ships.** |
| **Provider-agnostic design** | `docs/research/` | **The plan** — a reference design for running Scorecard's hosted data services on any cloud or self-hosted target | Reference design; not yet an official artifact. |

These are one system's present and future, not three unrelated projects. The
pipeline is a *producer* writing Scorecard results to a bucket; the API is the
*consumer* reading them back out over HTTP. Both arrived here from elsewhere, so
that the whole hosted data path lives in one place — which is the precondition
for moving it.

    CDN --> MCP["scorecard-mcp,<br/>other API clients"]
```

Arrows follow results, not requests. One thing the picture is worth reading
carefully for: the Action's `POST` path is the only one that refreshes the edge
promptly, because the cache purge fires from the publish handler; batch-produced
results reach clients as the cache expires.

They share a repository and, so far, **no code**. Converging them is the point
of landing them together; it has not happened yet and should be done as its own
change rather than incidentally (designs **C11** and **W10**, in
[`migrate-batch-pipeline`](openspec/changes/migrate-batch-pipeline/design.md) and
[`migrate-api`](openspec/changes/migrate-api/design.md)).

**Where the effort is going.** Both trees are actively developed. The
migration described in
[`scorecard#5208`](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/issues/5208) is complete,
and `api/` and `cron/` are held to the same rules as the rest of the
repository.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Common to everything here:

- **Go** matching [`go.mod`](go.mod) (1.25.x). If builds fail with a Go tool
  version mismatch across many stdlib packages, a stray `GOROOT` is the cause —
  prefix commands with `env -u GOROOT`.

Each component adds its own — an object store and SCM token, `ko` and `protoc`,
a cluster and its cloud dependencies. They are listed in that component's
README, linked from [Usage](#usage) below.

### Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-infra
cd scorecard-infra
make build     # go build ./...
make help      # every target, grouped
```

Building an individual component:

| Component | Where |
| --- | --- |
| **Results API** — the service that ships | [`api/README.md`](api/README.md) |
| **Batch scanning pipeline** | [`cron/README.md`](cron/README.md) |

## Usage

### Batch scanning pipeline

`cron/` is the batch scanning pipeline behind the weekly public Scorecard scan of
1M+ repositories. It was imported from
[`ossf/scorecard`](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard) with its full commit history
— 466 commits dating to 2020 — because the operational history *is* the runbook:
quota workarounds, shard sizing, SQS ack deadlines, and result formatting
migrations exist only as commit messages.
[`cron/initial-graft.md`](cron/initial-graft.md) records the terms of that import,
including what could not come across and where to trace it.

**Production is AWS (live 2026-09-06).** See:
- [`cron/README.md`](cron/README.md) for the pipeline components, the scan
inventories and how to add a repository to the weekly scan, and the build
targets.
- [`deploy/cron/README.md`](deploy/cron/README.md) for the AWS batch plane
deployment: infrastructure, configuration, apply order, and verification.

### Results API (api.scorecard.dev)

The service behind `api.scorecard.dev` and `api.securityscorecards.dev`,
imported from [`ossf/scorecard-webapp`](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-webapp)
with its full history. **This is the API that ships.** It is what every live
consumer already talks to: the project website's result viewer,
`img.shields.io`, the Scorecard GitHub Action's upload path, and `scorecard-mcp`.

The website that consumed it stays in `ossf/scorecard-webapp`, which remains its
home; only the Go API moved.

Endpoints, unchanged by the migration:

| Endpoint | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /projects/{platform}/{org}/{repo}` | Published result; `?commit=` for a pinned one |
| `GET /projects/{platform}/{org}/{repo}/badge` | `302` to `img.shields.io` (a redirect — it renders nothing itself) |
| `POST /projects/{platform}/{org}/{repo}` | Publish a result, after verifying its Sigstore certificate, transparency-log entry, and originating workflow |

Found a bug in the API? [Open an issue](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-infra/issues/new/choose)
in this repository. Bugs in the *viewer* at `scorecard.dev` belong in
[`ossf/scorecard-webapp`](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-webapp/issues).

**See [`api/README.md`](api/README.md)** for the tree layout, build targets,
image publication, and the two counterintuitive things about this tree —
and [`deploy/api/README.md`](deploy/api/README.md) for the deployment itself.

### Results API server

`cmd/scorecard-api` and `internal/` hold a separate, provider-agnostic
implementation of the results contract. **It is not the deployment path, and
nothing in production uses it** — what ships is `api/`, above. It is documented
in [`cmd/scorecard-api/README.md`](cmd/scorecard-api/README.md).

### Provider-agnostic migration

Scorecard's hosted infrastructure is being migrated to a new home. The purpose of
the work in `docs/research/` is to make that migration **provider-agnostic** —
portable across any cloud or self-hosted target rather than tied to a single
provider — with the smallest reliable footprint.

- [`docs/research/data-infra.md`](docs/research/data-infra.md) — the reconciled
  reference design: object store, serving tier, interchange format, public
  dataset, and cost transparency. Written to be proposable to the Scorecard
  **Infrastructure Working Group**; it is not an official artifact yet, and
  nothing in it is committed.
- [`docs/research/infra-seed-0.md`](docs/research/infra-seed-0.md) and
  [`infra-seed-1.md`](docs/research/infra-seed-1.md) — the two research passes it
  reconciles (component-selection breadth; correctness/protocol critique and data
  model).

This is the arc that gives the two systems above a shared destination. Getting the
pipeline out of `ossf/scorecard` is the precondition for it, not the work itself.

## Roadmap

The infrastructure migration — what is moving, what has already moved, and what
it means for consumers — is announced and tracked in
[`ossf/scorecard#5208`](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/issues/5208).

Backlog ownership across the Scorecard repositories, including which issues
belong here, is in
[`#77`](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-infra/issues/77).

Per-change plans live in [`openspec/changes/`](openspec/changes/); `openspec
list` shows their live status.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. For detailed contributing guidelines — including how
to add a repository to the weekly scan, and the rules that apply to the `cron/`
tree — please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

```sh
make build     # go build ./...
make test      # go test ./... -race
make lint      # golangci-lint run ./...   (config in .golangci.yml, aligned with ossf/scorecard)
make help      # every target, grouped — including the pipeline targets
```

An S3-compatible integration test runs when `SCORECARD_TEST_S3_URL` is set (e.g. a
local self-hosted S3-compatible store), and is skipped otherwise.

This repository is developed spec-first with
[OpenSpec](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec); see [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md)
