// Package model defines a lean in-repo mirror of the OpenSSF Scorecard JSON2
// wire format ([Result]), the repository reference the server routes on
// ([RepoRef]), and the provenance metadata ([Provenance]) that the server
// declares for every response.
//
// Per design decision D13, this package deliberately does NOT import the
// go-swagger-generated models from ossf/scorecard-webapp (which drag in the full
// go-openapi runtime).
//
// Note that half of D13's premise has expired: those generated models are no
// longer only upstream. They were imported into this repository as
// api/app/generated/models, and the go-openapi runtime is now a direct
// dependency of this module regardless of what this package does. The remaining
// argument is narrower but still holds — this package exists to unmarshal a
// handful of fields, and depending on the generated models to do it would couple
// the cache path to the API's generated code. Revisit when the two serving-tier
// implementations converge (design W10).
//
// Live results are formatted via pkg/scorecard.AsJSON2()
// and cached bytes are passed through unchanged; [Result] exists only to
// unmarshal the fields the server must introspect (score for the badge; repo
// commit, date, and version for freshness and provenance). It mirrors the
// canonical shape of pkg/scorecard.JSONScorecardResultV2 exactly.
//
// Provenance is delivered out of band (HTTP response headers and /capabilities),
// never embedded in the canonical JSON2 body, so webapp-compatible clients such
// as scorecard-mcp parse the body unchanged (design D4/D12).
